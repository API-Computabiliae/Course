**Quick React Course**

# Introduction to React

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where UI updates are frequent.

## Step 1: Setting Up a React App

1. Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React app:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```
2. Navigate into the newly created directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Your React app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Step 2: Understanding Components

1. React apps are built using components - reusable, independent pieces of UI.
2. Create components in the `src` folder and use them to build your app.

## Step 3: Managing State and Props

1. State holds data that can change over time. Props pass data from a parent component down to a child component.
2. Use `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage state and side effects.

## Step 4: Routing with React Router

1. Install React Router with:
   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```
2. Set up routes to navigate between different views.

## Step 5: Making HTTP Requests

1. Use `fetch` or libraries like Axios to make API calls from your React app.
2. Handle responses and update state accordingly.

## Step 6: Handling Forms and User Input

1. Use controlled components to manage form inputs.
2. Handle form submissions and update state with user input.

## Step 7: Styling with CSS-in-JS or CSS Modules

1. Choose a styling approach like CSS-in-JS libraries (Styled Components) or CSS Modules for scoped styling.
